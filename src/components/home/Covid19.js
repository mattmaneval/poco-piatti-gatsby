      <h2>Our Covid-19 Response</h2>
      <p>Poco Piattiâ€˜s number one priority is the well-being of our staff and our loyal patrons.
        Our Perrysburg and Sylvania locations will be open daily from 12:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. for take out. Currently,
        our Downtown location is closed until further notice.
        We have a plan in place for curbside pickup at both locations with call-in - <a href="tel:419-931-0281">419-931-0281</a> - as well as online ordering.
        There will also be Beirut Food Truck announcements on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PocoPiatti">Facebook</a> page.
        Stay safe and healthy and we hope to help serve you as best we can.
